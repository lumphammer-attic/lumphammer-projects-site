# About this site

## This site is written using [SvelteKit][sk], a framework for building sites using [Svelte][sv].

It runs in fully-prerendered mode, so we're serving static html from the server
and no JS is required client-side, and it serves and renders fast. *But* if you do have JS, it will then re-hydrate in your browser and become a fully functional dynamic app.
